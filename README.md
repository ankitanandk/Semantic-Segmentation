# Semantic-Segmentation
To Automate drug testing, we need to find total number of colonies in induced cell. We created a Double U-Net model to identify cell colonies. And to locate the anomaly we cannot use CNN as we need the pixel information which can be extracted by U-Net.

To access the main code, you can lookup Double U Net.ipynb file.

Initial trial with different models are also added to compare the results obtained from those.
